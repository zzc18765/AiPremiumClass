Have you\nhad many brothers, Spirit?'\n\n'More than eighteen hundred,' said the Ghost.\n\n'A tremendous family to provide for,' muttered Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present rose.\n\n'Spirit,' said Scrooge submissively, 'conduct me where you will.

To-night if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.'\n\n'Touch my robe!'\n\nScrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.\n\nHolly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry,\nbrawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch,\nall vanished instantly. So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow, the\nhour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning,\nwhere (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk\nand not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement\nin front of their dwellings, and from the tops of their houses, whence\nit was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the\nroad below, and splitting into artificial little snowstorms.\n\nThe house-fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker,\ncontrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with\nthe dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed\nup in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons: furrows\nthat crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great\nstreets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the\nthick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy, and the shortest\nstreets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen,\nwhose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all\nthe chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were\nblazing away to their dear heart's content. There was nothing very\ncheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of\ncheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer\nsun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.\n\n[Illustration: THERE WAS NOTHING VERY CHEERFUL IN THE CLIMATE]\n\nFor the people who were shovelling away on the house-tops were jovial\nand full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now\nand then exchanging a facetious snowball--better-natured missile far\nthan many a wordy jest--laughing heartily if it went right, and not less\nheartily if it went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open,\nand the fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great,\nround, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of\njolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the\nstreet in their apoplectic opulence: There were ruddy, brown-faced,\nbroad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their growth\nlike Spanish friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at\nthe girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up\nmistletoe. There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming\npyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers'\nbenevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths might\nwater gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and\nbrown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and\npleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were\nNorfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy, setting off the yellow of the\noranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy\npersons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper\nbags and eaten after dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth\namong these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and\nstagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was something going\non; and, to a fish, went gasping round and round their little world in\nslow and passionless excitement.\n\nThe Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters\ndown, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses!
