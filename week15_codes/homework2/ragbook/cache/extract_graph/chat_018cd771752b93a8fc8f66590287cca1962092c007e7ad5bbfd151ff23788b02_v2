But how much greater was his\nhorror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it\nwere too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its\nbreast!\n\nScrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face.\n\n'Mercy!' he said. 'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?'\n\n'Man of the worldly mind!' replied the Ghost, 'do you believe in me or\nnot?'\n\n'I do,' said Scrooge; 'I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and\nwhy do they come to me?'\n\n'It is required of every man,' the Ghost returned, 'that the spirit\nwithin him should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far and\nwide; and, if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do\nso after death. It is doomed to wander through the world--oh, woe is\nme!--and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth,\nand turned to happiness!'\n\nAgain the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain and wrung its\nshadowy hands.\n\n'You are fettered,' said Scrooge, trembling. 'Tell me why?'\n\n'I wear the chain I forged in life,' replied the Ghost. 'I made it link\nby link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of\nmy own free will I wore it. Is its pattern strange to _you_?'\n\nScrooge trembled more and more.\n\n'Or would you know,' pursued the Ghost, 'the weight and length of the\nstrong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this\nseven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a\nponderous chain!'\n\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding\nhimself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he\ncould see nothing.\n\n'Jacob!' he said imploringly. 'Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak\ncomfort to me, Jacob!'\n\n'I have none to give,' the Ghost replied. 'It comes from other regions,\nEbenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of\nmen. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all\npermitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere.\nMy spirit never walked beyond our counting-house--mark me;--in life my\nspirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole;\nand weary journeys lie before me!'\n\nIt was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became thoughtful, to put his\nhands in his breeches pockets. Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he\ndid so now, but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his knees.\n\n[Illustration: ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND]\n\n'You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,' Scrooge observed in a\nbusiness-like manner, though with humility and deference.\n\n'Slow!' the Ghost repeated.\n\n'Seven years dead,' mused Scrooge. 'And travelling all the time?'\n\n'The whole time,' said the Ghost. 'No rest, no peace. Incessant torture\nof remorse.'\n\n'You travel fast?' said Scrooge.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n'On the wings of the wind,' replied the Ghost.\n\n'You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years,'\nsaid Scrooge.\n\nThe Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so\nhideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have\nbeen justified in indicting it for a nuisance.\n\n'Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,' cried the phantom, 'not to know\nthat ages of incessant labour, by immortal creatures, for this earth\nmust pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is\nall developed! Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in\nits little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too\nshort for its vast means of usefulness! Not to know that no space of\nregret can make amends for one life's opportunities misused! Yet such\nwas I! Oh, such was I!'\n\n'But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,' faltered Scrooge,\nwho now began to apply this to himself.\n\n'Business!' cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again. 'Mankind was my\nbusiness. The common welfare was my business; charity, mercy,\nforbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my\ntrade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my\nbusiness!'\n\nIt held up its chain at arm's-length, as if that were the cause of all\nits unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.\n\n'At this time of the rolling year,' the spectre said, 'I suffer most.\nWhy did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down,\nand never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a\npoor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have\nconducted _me_?'\n\nScrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this\nrate, and began to quake exceedingly.\n\n'Hear me!' cried the Ghost. 'My time is nearly gone.'\n\n'I will,' said Scrooge.
