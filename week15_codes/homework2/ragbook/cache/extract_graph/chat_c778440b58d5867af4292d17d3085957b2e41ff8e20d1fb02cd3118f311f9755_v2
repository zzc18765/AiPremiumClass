'A merrier Christmas,\nBob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year!

He did it all, and infinitely more;\nand to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as\ngood a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old\nCity knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old\nworld. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them\nlaugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that\nnothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did\nnot have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as\nthese would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they\nshould wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less\nattractive forms. His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough for\nhim.\n\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the\nTotal-Abstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of\nhim that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed\nthe knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as\nTiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!\n\n[Illustration]\n\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\n|Transcriber's note: The Contents were added by the transcriber.|\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A CHRISTMAS CAROL ***\n\n\n    \n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.
