Think\nof that! Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a week himself; he pocketed on\nSaturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of\nChristmas Present blessed his four-roomed house!\n\nThen up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a\ntwice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a\ngoodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda\nCratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master\nPeter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting\nthe corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property,\nconferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth,\nrejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his\nlinen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and\ngirl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt\nthe goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts\nof sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and\nexalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud,\nalthough his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow\npotatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out\nand peeled.\n\n'What has ever got your precious father, then?' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And\nyour brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by\nhalf an hour!'\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' said a girl, appearing as she spoke.\n\n'Here's Martha, mother!' cried the two young Cratchits. 'Hurrah! There's\n_such_ a goose, Martha!'\n\n'Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!' said Mrs.\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet\nfor her with officious zeal.\n\n'We'd a deal of work to finish up last night,' replied the girl, 'and\nhad to clear away this morning, mother!'\n\n'Well! never mind so long as you are come,' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'Sit ye\ndown before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!'\n\n'No, no! There's father coming,' cried the two young Cratchits, who were\neverywhere at once. 'Hide, Martha, hide!'\n\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father, with at least\nthree feet of comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before\nhim, and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look\nseasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a\nlittle crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!\n\n'Why, where's our Martha?' cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\n\n'Not coming,' said Mrs. Cratchit.\n\n'Not coming!' said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;\nfor he had been Tim's blood-horse all the way from church, and had come\nhome rampant. 'Not coming upon Christmas Day!'\n\nMartha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so\nshe came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his\narms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off\ninto the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the\ncopper.\n\n'And how did little Tim behave?' asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had\nrallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his\nheart's content.\n\n'As good as gold,' said Bob, 'and better. Somehow, he gets thoughtful,\nsitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever\nheard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the\nchurch, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to\nremember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men\nsee.'\n\nBob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when\nhe said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\n\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny\nTim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and\nsister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his\ncuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were capable of being made more\nshabby--compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and\nstirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master\nPeter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose,\nwith which they soon returned in high procession.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of\nall birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of\ncourse--and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dust\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BOB CRATCHIT<|>PERSON<|>Bob Cratchit is a character who works hard for a meager salary and is the father of the Cratchit family, known for his love and care for his family.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MRS.
