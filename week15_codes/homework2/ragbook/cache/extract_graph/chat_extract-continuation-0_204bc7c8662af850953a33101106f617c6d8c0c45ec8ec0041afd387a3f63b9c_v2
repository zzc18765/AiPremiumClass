Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge's nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n'Bah!' said Scrooge. 'Humbug!'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew. 'You don't mean\nthat, I am sure?'\n\n'I do,' said Scrooge. 'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.'\n\n'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily. 'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'\n\n'Don't be cross, uncle!' said the nephew.\n\n'What else can I be,' returned the uncle, 'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCROOGE<|>PERSON<|>Scrooge is a miserly old man who despises Christmas and is known for his cold demeanor and lack of generosity.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCROOGE'S NEPHEW<|>PERSON<|>Scrooge's nephew is a cheerful and optimistic character who tries to spread the joy of Christmas to his uncle.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHRISTMAS<|>EVENT<|>Christmas is a holiday celebrated on December 25th, associated with joy, giving, and family gatherings, which Scrooge dismisses as a humbug.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE<|>SCROOGE'S NEPHEW<|>Scrooge's nephew is trying to convince Scrooge to embrace the spirit of Christmas, highlighting their contrasting views on the holiday<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCROOGE<|>CHRISTMAS<|>Scrooge has a negative attitude towards Christmas, viewing it as a time of financial burden rather than joy<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
